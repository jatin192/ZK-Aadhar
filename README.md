# ZK Aadhaar

Zero Knowledge Aadhaar is a zero-knowledge proof solution that allows users to prove their Aadhaar identity while maintaining complete privacy and anonymity. This implementation uses React.js with Vite for a fast and efficient development experience.

# Live Demo

## Features

- **Verify Identity Privately:** Verify your Aadhaar identity without revealing actual Aadhaar data.
- **Blockchain Proof Storage:** Secure storage and verification of proofs on the blockchain.
- **Client-Side ZK Proof Generation:** Generate zero-knowledge proofs on the client side for maximum privacy.
- **On-Chain Proof Verification:** Verify previously generated proofs directly on the blockchain.
- **No Aadhaar Data Storage:** Only zero-knowledge proofs are stored, with no access to original Aadhaar data.


## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Anon Aadhaar SDK
- **Styling:** CSS/SCSS
- **Development:** Node.js

## Use Cases

- **User Identity Verification:** Verify your Aadhaar identity without revealing personal data.
- **Business Authentication:** Businesses can authenticate users while respecting privacy.
- **Tamper-Proof Blockchain Storage:** Verification proofs are securely stored on the blockchain.
- **Selective Identity Verification:** Users can choose which parts of their identity to verify.

## How to Use

1. **Connect Your Wallet:**  
   Start the application and connect your Web3 wallet (such as MetaMask) to interact with the system.

2. **Upload Aadhaar PDF:**  
   Provide your Aadhaar PDF file through the secure interface for verification. Your data is never exposed.

3. **Generate Proof:**  
   The application will generate a zero-knowledge proof of your Aadhaar data, which ensures that your personal information is kept private.

4. **Proof on Blockchain:**  
   The zero-knowledge proof is then stored on the blockchain for verification purposes.

5. **Verify Later:**  
   Anyone can verify your identity proof later without ever accessing or viewing your original Aadhaar data.
